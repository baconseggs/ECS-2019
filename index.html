        <h1 class="display">Welcome to ECS</h1>
        <p class="lead">This site was built with one purpose: make things easier and more interactive for you in ECS.
            With this site, you're not only a student, you're also a <span class="emphasis">contributor</span>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="why">
        <h3>Why is this site here?</h3>
        <p>Well, to be honest, everyone doesn't learn at the same pace...and that's completely normal! Some people need
            a bit
            of practice with different components that we've learned about over the last few weeks. Some of you guys are
            ready to move on to more challenging topics. In order for you to get the best experience out of this class,
            you need to be able to move at your own pace; that's why I've designed this site.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="what">
        <h3>What am I going to learn?</h3>
        <div class="what-deets">
            <p>A little bit of everything...this is meant to be an introductory class that teaches you <i>how</i>
                computers
                think. We'll get the chance to build some websites, style them, and eventually add in some different
                functionalities with JavaScript. The year will culminate with a giant front-end project wherein you'll
                develop a fully functioning site for a teacher in the school!</p>

    <section class="how">
        <h3>How do I get started?</h3>
        <div class="how-deets">
            <p>You've got a few different choices. There are some projects that you'll do on your own during an alotted
                period of time. We do these for HTML/CSS and then again for JavaScript. However, I also have a couple of
                pages that are "cheatsheets" which are simply meant as resources to help you create what you want. The
                easiest thing to do is press this button to watch a quick intro video.</p>
